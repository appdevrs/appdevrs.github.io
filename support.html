You found a Bug within the APP?<br>
It doesn't work like intended or expected?<br>
You think the App should behave in a different way to make it more user friendly?<br>
Do you even have ideas for new functions that you are missing from the App?<br>
<br>
Let me know your feedback so I can continue improving the App for all of us.<br>
