Let me know your feedback so I can continue improving the App for all of us.<br>

I am developing and maintaining this App in my spare time, free for everyone who is interested in using it.<br>
You will discover no ads, subscription models or microtransactions in this App, as I decided to offer a useful App without any interfering elements.<br>
But publishing it to Apples AppStore is no free service.<br>
If you would like to help keeping the App available and up to date, I am very thankful for your support.<br>
